<h1>Worm Tank</h1>
<p>Worm tank is a simulation of a group of worms feeding in a tank.</p>
<p>The worms are controlled by different <a href="brains.html">brains</a>
which get input from one or more <a href="sensors.html">sensors</a>
that can tell it where food, other worms or walls are with various
accuracy.</p>
<p>In normal training mode the worms are left to roam around the tank
finding food until all but ten of them die of starvation.</p>
<p>Once down to the last ten worms a new generation is created, which
includes the last ten worms with a group of randomly generated children.
The worm which has the most energy left, is designated the leader and
he gets more children, including two created by mixing it with the
other worms in the top ten.</p>
<p>The other modes allow you to pit the worms against each other
to see which survives better.</p>
