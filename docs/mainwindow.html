<h1>Worm Tank - Main Window</h1>
<p>The main window shows the running simulation with and some statistics
on previous generations.</p>
<p>The title of this window is changed to show what is currently
running in the tank.</p>
<p>The top area contains information on the current run.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Generation</td>
    <td>The current generation being run</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tick</td>
    <td>The time in the current generation measured in ticks,
    where each tick is one move off all the worms.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Worms Left</td>
    <td>Number of worm alive in the tank</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Food Left</td>
    <td>Amount of food left in the tank</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Max energy</td>
    <td>The maximum energy any one worm has had</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>Under the information on the current run is the worm tank itself.
This shows the worms wandering around the tank. The green dots are the
food they eat and the longer moving coloured lines are the worms.</p>
<p>The worms grow and shrink in length depending on the amount
of energy they have.</p>
<p>To see a key for the colours of the worms use the
<a href="viewmenu.html#wormlist">View menu, Worm list option</a>.
</p>
<p>The section to the right marked <b>Leader stats</b> gives information
about the worm with the most energy at the end of the generation.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Age</td>
    <td>The number of generation the leader has been alive.
        i.e. The leader was in the top ten worms.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Leading for</td>
    <td>The number of generations the leader has been at the top
        at the end of the generation.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ancestors</td>
    <td>This is a list of which worm won each generation,
        with the last generation on the left.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The section to the right marked <b>Last generation stats</b>
gives information on the last finished generation.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Ticks</td>
    <td>The time the last generation lasted for</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Food Left</td>
    <td>The amount of food left when the generation finished</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Max energy</td>
    <td>The maximum energy any one worm has had in the last generation</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The three line charts at the bottom summarize the
history of the previous generations so trends can
be seen.</p>
<p>The charts go from the oldest generation
on the left to the last generation on the right.
Two generations need to have passed before anything
is shown.
