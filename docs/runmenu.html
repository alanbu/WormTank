<h1>Worm Tank - Run Menu</h1>
<p>The Run Menu qives options to change the currenty running simulation. The options are:</p>
<table>
<tr>
   <td><a href="#train">Train</a></td>
   <td>Select a worm type and start it training</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><a href="#battle">Battle</a></td>
   <td>Select two worm types to compete</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="train">Train</h2>

<p>A window is shown allowing you to choose a worm type to train.</p>
<p>Pressing <b>OK</b> saves the current tank
and loads the latest generation of the given worm type.</p>
<p>If the <b>Reset</b> check box is set the worm type is returned
to the first generation.</p>

<p>In training mode 100 worms are created for the first generation
and then the simulation run to update the worms positions
and health.</p>

<p>When the number of worms reduces to 10 a new generation is started.</p>

<p>The new generation consists of the 10 survivors from the previous
generation and then 90 new children randomly created based on the 10
survivors.</p>

<p>The worm that had the most energy at the end of the generation is
designated the leader. The leader is given more children than the others
including some based by averaging or mixing it with the rest of the
top ten.</p>


<h2 id="battle">Battle</h2>

<p>A window is shown allowing you to choose two worm types to battle
against each other.</p>
<p>Pressing <b>OK</b> saves the current tank
and loads the latest generation of the two worm types to battle.</p>
<p>The <b>First generation</b> check box means the two sides are
generated randomly rather than using the latest generation.</p>

<p>In battle mode 10 of each type of worm are created and the
simulation run to update the worms positions and health.</p>

<p>The battle is won when there is only one type of worm left
in the tank.<p>
<p>When the battle is won a message is shown displaying the results
and the last worms are left wandering around behind the message.<p>
<p>Select an option from the Run menu to leave the battle and do
something else.</p>
