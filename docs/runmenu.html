to the first generation.</p>

<p>In training mode 100 worms are created for the first generation
and then the simulation run to update the worms positions
and health.</p>

<p>When the number of worms reduces to 10 a new generation is started.</p>

<p>The new generation consists of the 10 survivors from the previous
generation and then 90 new children randomly created based on the 10
survivors.</p>

<p>The worm that had the most energy at the end of the generation is
designated the leader. The leader is given more children than the others
including some based by averaging or mixing it with the rest of the

simulation run to update the worms positions and health.</p>

worm types competing against each other.</p>
<p>The match is run for up to four generations. Each generation
is ended when there are only ten worms left. The next generation
is started by adding ten new worms as children of the ten
survivors.</p>
<p>If after a generation there is only one type of worm left
the game finishes.</p>
<p>The game is scored with points added for every worm left
(up to a maximum of 10) at the end of a generation. If the
