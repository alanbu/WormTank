<h1>Worm Tank - Sensors</h1>

<p>The sensors are what the worms use to detect what is around them
in the worm tank.</p>
<p>The "senses" of the worm is split into three sections, ahead, +/-45
degrees, left, -45 to - 135 degrees and right, +45 to +135 degrees.
An extra 4th sensor is set if there is nothing ahead, left or right.</p>
<p>The sensors are made up of two parts. What the object they can detect
is: <b>food</b>, <b>wall</b> or <b>other worms</b> and how they can detect
them:
<table>
<tr>
   <td><b>Seen</b></td>
   <td>One or more objects are in the section</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><b>Next To</b></td>
   <td>The next move in that direction will move on to an object</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><b>Range</b></td>
   <td>There is one or more object within the given range. 
       This sensor can be given multiple ranges in which case the object is marked as
       seen in the closest range it appears in and not the further away ones.
   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><b>Count</b></td>
   <td>A count of the objects with the given range.
       This sensor can be given multiple ranges in which case the object is counted
       in the closest range it appears in and not the further away ones.    
   </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The sensors are referred to in other pages by contatenating the object
they are looking for with how they can detect them and the range (if applicable).</p>
<p>e.g. FoodSeen is a sensor to detect food in any direction. WormRange10 is a
sensor that detects Worms within a range of 10.</p>
