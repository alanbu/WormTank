# WormTank
Worm tank is a primitive simulation of a group of worms feeding in a tank.

The worms are controlled by different brains which get input from one or more sensors that can tell it where food, other worms or walls are with various accuracy.

In normal training mode the worms are left to roam around the tank finding food until all but ten of them die of starvation.

This application was mainly created for me to try out QT5
